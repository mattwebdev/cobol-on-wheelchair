# COBOL on Wheelchair

A micro web-framework for COBOL that proves old dogs can learn new tricks! ðŸ¦¿

## Features

- **Modern Server Architecture**
  - Node.js-based server with hot reloading
  - Development mode with automatic COBOL compilation
  - Static file serving
  - Production-ready deployment options

- **Routing System**
  - Path-based routing with variable support (`/user/%id`)
  - HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
  - Method-specific route handling

- **Request Handling**
  - Path variables extraction
  - Query string parsing (`?key=value`)
  - Form data processing (POST/PUT/PATCH)
  - URL-decoded parameter support

- **Template Engine**
  - Conditional rendering (`{{#if}}`)
  - Loop support (`{{#each}}`)
  - Variable substitution (`{{variable}}`)
  - HTML escaping for security
  - Array support
  - Clean separation of logic and presentation

## Prerequisites

### Linux/macOS
* [GNU Cobol](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) (`sudo apt-get install open-cobol`)
* Node.js 18 or higher
* Basic understanding of COBOL (or a sense of adventure!)

### Windows
* [GnuCOBOL for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/files/gnucobol/)
  - Download and run the installer (e.g., `GnuCOBOL-3.1.2-64bit-MinGW-setup.exe`)
  - Add GnuCOBOL's bin directory to your PATH (usually `C:\GnuCOBOL\bin`)
* Node.js 18 or higher from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* Windows Terminal or PowerShell
* Docker Desktop (optional, for containerized setup)

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azac/cobol-on-wheelchair/
cd cobol-on-wheelchair

# Install dependencies and compile
npm install
npm run build

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# OR start production server
npm start

# The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Docker Installation

The framework includes Docker support for easy setup and deployment:

```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running first!

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t cobol-on-wheelchair .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 cobol-on-wheelchair

# For development with hot reload and local file mounting
# On Windows PowerShell:
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app cobol-on-wheelchair npm run dev
# On Windows CMD:
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v %cd%:/app cobol-on-wheelchair npm run dev
# On Linux/macOS:
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app cobol-on-wheelchair npm run dev
```

## Development Features

- Hot reloading of COBOL files
- Automatic recompilation on changes
- Development server with live feedback
- Static file serving from `public` directory
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **COBOL Compiler Not Found**
   - **Windows**: Ensure GnuCOBOL is installed and added to PATH
   - **Linux**: Install with `sudo apt-get install open-cobol`
   - **macOS**: Install with Homebrew: `brew install gnu-cobol`

2. **Build Fails**
   - Check if `cobc` is available in your terminal/command prompt
   - Ensure all .cbl files are in their correct directories
   - Try running `npm run clean` before `npm run build`

3. **Docker Issues**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - On Windows, use PowerShell or CMD with correct volume mount syntax
   - Check Docker Desktop settings if volume mounting fails

4. **Server Won't Start**
   - Verify Node.js version (18+ required)
   - Check if port 3000 is available
   - Ensure COBOL compilation succeeded
   - Look for the compiled `the.cow` binary

## Quick Start

1. Define a route in `config.cbl`:
```cobol
move "/hello/%name"    to routing-pattern(1).
move "GET"             to routing-method(1).
move "sayhello"        to routing-destiny(1).
```

2. Create a controller in `controllers/sayhello.cbl`:
```cobol
identification division.
program-id. sayhello.

data division.
working-storage section.
01 the-vars.
   03 COW-vars occurs 99 times.
      05 COW-varname    pic x(99).
      05 COW-varvalue   pic x(99).
      05 COW-var-type   pic x(1).

linkage section.
01 path-values.
   05 path-query-values occurs 10 times.
      10 path-query-value-name  pic x(90).
      10 path-query-value       pic x(90).

procedure division using path-values.
    move "username" to COW-varname(1).
    move path-query-value(1) to COW-varvalue(1).
    move "S" to COW-var-type(1).
    
    call 'cowtemplateplus' using the-vars "hello.cow".
    goback.
end program sayhello.
```

3. Create a template in `views/hello.cow`:
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, {{username}}!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Examples

The framework includes several examples:
- Basic routing (`/`)
- Path variables (`/showname/Adrian`)
- Calculator with path params (`/showsum/22/11`)
- Form handling with POST (`/form`)
- Advanced template features (`/advanced`)

## Security Features

- Automatic HTML escaping in templates
- Request validation
- Secure static file serving
- Production-ready server configuration

While this is still primarily an educational framework, security best practices are followed where possible.
